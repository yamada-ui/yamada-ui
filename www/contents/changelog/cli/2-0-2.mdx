## Patch changes

- [#5287](https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui/pull/5287) [d5b44c6](https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui/commit/d5b44c64416bf2628dd6af71c48ab309856fa608) Thanks [@bmthd](https://github.com/bmthd)! - fix: add shebang to CLI binary via tsdown banner configuration

  Add `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang to the CLI binary by configuring tsdown's banner option.
  This fixes execution issues on Linux where the CLI failed with "import: not found" errors
  because the shell tried to execute the JavaScript file as a shell script.

  Fixes #5286
