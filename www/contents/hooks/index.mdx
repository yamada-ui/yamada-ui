  Convenient custom hooks are provided in Yamada UI to help you build your
  projects more quickly.

## Usage

Yamada UI provides hooks in two ways. One is a new method of downloading hooks locally from [CLI](/docs/components/cli). The other is the traditional method of importing hooks from modules.

### Download

The cases for downloading hooks locally from [CLI](/docs/components/cli) are as follows.

- Customize the initial value or logic of the hook.
- Fix a bug in the hook's logic by directly modifying it.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm yamada-cli add use-disclosure
```

```bash [npm]
npm yamada-cli add use-disclosure
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn yamada-cli add use-disclosure
```

```bash [bun]
bun yamada-cli add use-disclosure
```

:::

:::note
Yamada UI updates the hooks, you can easily update them in the same way as [Update Components](/docs/components/cli#update-components). If your changes conflict with the updates, they will be displayed in the same way as the [HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_conflicts_are_presented) of [Git](https://git-scm.com), and you can easily resolve them.
:::

### Import

If you want to use the hook without making any changes, you can simply import the hook from the module.

:::code-group

```tsx [package]
import { useDisclosure } from "@yamada-ui/react"
```

```tsx [alias]
import { useDisclosure } from "@/components/ui"
```

```tsx [monorepo]
import { useDisclosure } from "@workspaces/ui"
```
