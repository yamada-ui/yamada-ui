`ui` is an object of JSX elements enabled with Yamada UI's style system, and can also be used as a function for custom components to receive Yamada UI's style system.

## Usage

Use the `ui.<element>` notation to generate basic HTML elements with a style system.
For example, to generate a plain HTML `button` element with a style system, write `<ui.button />`.

```tsx
<ui.button
  py="sm"
  px="md"
  rounded="md"
  bg="purple.600"
  color="white"
  _hover={{ bg: "purple.500" }}
>
  Click me!
</ui.button>
```

## Creating a Component

`ui` can be used in two ways: the JSX element `<ui.div />` and the function that returns a JSX element `ui('div')`.

The function is suitable for generating simple components.

```tsx live=false
import { ui } from "@yamada-ui/core"

const Button = ui("button")

const Demo = () => {
  return <Button>Click me!</Button>
}
```

You can also set default styles.

```tsx live=false
import { ui } from "@yamada-ui/core"

const Button = ui("button", {
  baseStyle: {
    py: "sm",
    px: "md",
    rounded: "md",
    bg: "purple.600",
    color: "white",
    _hover: { bg: "purple.500" },
  },
})

const Demo = () => {
  return <Button>Click me!</Button>
}
```

You can pass a custom component as an argument and generate a custom component with the Yamada UI style system enabled.

```tsx live=false
import { ui } from "@yamada-ui/core"
import { YourComponent } from "./your-component"

const NewComponent = ui(YourComponent)

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <NewComponent
      py="sm"
      px="md"
      rounded="md"
      bg="purple.600"
      color="white"
      _hover={{ bg: "purple.500" }}
    >
      Click me!
    </NewComponent>
  )
}
```

:::note
This is effective when you want to use the Yamada UI style system with components from other libraries.
:::

If a custom component's `prop` overlaps with a `prop` from [Style Props](/styled-system/style-props), the `prop` will be absorbed into the Yamada UI style system and will not be passed to the custom component. If you want to pass the `prop` to the custom component without it being absorbed by the Yamada UI style system, you can set `disableStyleProp`.

```tsx live=false
const NewComponent = ui(YourComponent, {
  disableStyleProp: (prop) => ["targetProp"].includes(prop),
})
```

## Allowing the Transfer of `props`

By default, `ui` filters out the `props` of the Yamada UI style system and incorporates them into the DOM. To control how and which `props` are transferred, you can set `shouldForwardProp`.

Here is a simple example that allows all `props` (including those of the Yamada UI style system) except for `targetProp`.

```tsx live=false
const NewComponent = ui(YourComponent, {
  shouldForwardProp: (prop) => !["targetProp"].includes(prop),
})
```

Here's an example combined with Yamada UI's default `shouldForwardProp`.

```tsx live=false
import { ui, shouldForwardProp } from "@yamada-ui/core"

const NewComponent = ui(YourComponent, {
  shouldForwardProp: (prop) => {
    const isUIProps = !shouldForwardProp(prop)

    if (isUIProps) return false

    return !["targetProp"].includes(prop)
  },
})
```
