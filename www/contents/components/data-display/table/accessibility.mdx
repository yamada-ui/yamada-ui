  selection, and click events.

The `Table` follows the [WAI-ARIA - Table Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/table/) for accessibility.

Setting an `aria-label` on the `Table` allows it to be read by screen readers.

```tsx live=false
<Table columns={columns} data={data} aria-label="DRAGON BALL characters" />
```
