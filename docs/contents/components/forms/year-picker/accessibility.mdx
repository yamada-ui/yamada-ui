The `YearPicker` follows the [WAI-ARIA - Combobox Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) for accessibility.

If you are not using `FormControl`, set `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to `YearPicker`.

```tsx live=false
<YearPicker placeholder="YYYY" aria-label="Birthday" />
```

```tsx live=false
<VStack gap="sm">
  <Heading as="h3" id="label">
    Birthday
  </Heading>

  <YearPicker placeholder="YYYY" aria-labelledby="label" />
</VStack>
```
