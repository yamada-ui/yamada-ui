You can generate types of tokens for customized themes such as colors and font sizes using Yamada CLI.

The CLI reads the customized theme and generates token types in `node_modules/@yamada-ui/core/dist/generated-theme.types.d.ts`.

## Installation

Run either of the following commands in the terminal.

<PackageManagers
  packageNameOrCommand={{
    pnpm: "pnpm add --save-dev @yamada-ui/cli",
    npm: "npm install --save-dev @yamada-ui/cli",
    yarn: "yarn add --dev @yamada-ui/cli",
    bun: "bun add --dev @yamada-ui/cli",
  }}
/>

Add a script to `package.json` and specify the location of the customized theme in the script.

```json title=package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts" : {
    ...
    "theme" : "yamada-cli tokens path/to/theme.ts",
    "theme:watch" : "yamada-cli tokens path/to/theme.ts --watch",
  } „ÄÅ
  ...
}
```

:::note status=warning
Don't forget to replace `path/to/theme.ts`.
:::

:::note status=warning
Some package managers like `pnpm` may not find the output destination due to symbolic links, etc. In that case, use the `--out` option of the CLI to specify the output destination.
:::

## Usage

To generate the type of theme, execute any of the following scripts.

<PackageManagers
  packageNameOrCommand={{
    pnpm: "pnpm theme",
    npm: "npm run theme",
    yarn: "yarn theme",
    bun: "bun run theme",
  }}
/>

If you want to continuously generate types while customizing the theme, execute any of the following scripts.

<PackageManagers
  packageNameOrCommand={{
    pnpm: "pnpm theme:watch",
    npm: "npm run theme:watch",
    yarn: "yarn theme:watch",
    bun: "bun run theme:watch",
  }}
/>
