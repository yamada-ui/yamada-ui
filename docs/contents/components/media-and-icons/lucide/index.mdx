## Import

<PackageManagers packageNameOrCommand="@yamada-ui/lucide" />

:::note status=warning
`@yamada-ui/lucide` is not included in `@yamada-ui/react`, so it needs to be installed separately.
:::

## Usage

```ts
import { Ghost } from "@yamada-ui/lucide"
```

```tsx
<Ghost />
```

### Using icons from [Lucide lab](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide-lab)

To use icons from [Lucide lab](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide-lab), use the `Icon` component.

```ts
import { Icon as LucideIcon } from "@yamada-ui/lucide"
import { burger } from "@lucide/lab"
```

```tsx
<LucideIcon icon={burger} />
```

:::note
[Lucide lab](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide-lab) is a collection of experimental or pre-release icons that are not included in [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).
:::

### Creating a single generic component

It is also possible to create a single generic component, but it is not recommended.

```tsx live=false
const LucideIcon: FC<IconProps & { name: IconNames }> = ({ name, ...rest }) => {
  const Icon = icons[name]

  return <Icon {...rest} />
}

return <LucideIcon name="Ghost" />
```

:::note status=error
In the example above, all ES modules are imported, so be careful when using it. Importing all icons can significantly increase the build size of your application and potentially degrade performance. This is particularly important when using bundlers such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
