  <Text>{mounted ? "Component is mounted" : "Component is not mounted"}</Text>
)
```

### Use Delay

To use a delay, specify a number (milliseconds) for `delay`.

```tsx preview functional client
const mounted = useMounted({ state: true, delay: 1000 })

return <Text>{mounted ? "Mounted after delay" : "Waiting..."}</Text>
