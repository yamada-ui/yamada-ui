## Respect

Yamada UI has drawn a lot of inspiration from [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui), [MUI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) and [Mantine UI](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine). This has brought me wonderful experiences in my life. I am deeply grateful to Segun Adebayo and all the gods who have given me such experiences. And I love them.
