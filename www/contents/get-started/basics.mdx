title: Learn the Basics
description: Read a 3-minute tutorial to learn the basics of Yamada UI's components, styling, responsive design, and color mode.
---

This guide will help you understand the concepts of Yamada UI. We recommend reading this guide before you start developing with Yamada UI.

:::tip
This guide is basic and is intended to give you a sense of the **fun** of developing with Yamada UI. Therefore, it does not explain each concept and feature in depth. If you want to know more, please check the links within the page.

## Components

Yamada UI provides components in two ways. One is a new method of downloading components locally from [CLI](/docs/components/cli). The other is the traditional method of importing components from modules.

### Download

The cases for downloading components locally from [CLI](/docs/components/cli) are as follows.

- Customize the [variant](/docs/components/styled#variant-style) or [size](/docs/components/styled#size-style) styles of the component.
- Customize the initial value or logic of the component.
- Fix a bug in the component's style or logic by directly modifying it.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm yamada-cli add button
```

```bash [npm]
npm yamada-cli add button
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn yamada-cli add button
```

```bash [bun]
bun yamada-cli add button
```

:::

:::note
Yamada UI updates the components, you can easily update the components by checking the [Check Differences](/docs/components/cli#check-differences) or [Update Components](/docs/components/cli#update-components) in [CLI](/docs/components/cli). If your changes conflict with the updates, they will be displayed in the same way as the [HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_conflicts_are_presented) of [Git](https://git-scm.com), and you can easily resolve them.
:::

### Import

If you want to use the component without making any changes, you can simply import the component from the module.

:::code-group

```tsx [package]
import { Button } from "@yamada-ui/react"
```

```tsx [alias]
import { Button } from "@/components/ui"
```

```tsx [monorepo]
import { Button } from "@workspaces/ui"
```

:::

:::note

## Styling

[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) is a prop that applies styles to elements using props. Style Props follows the [CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/CSS/Properties) and provides all properties in camelCase.

```tsx preview
<Box p="md" bg="bg.contrast" color="fg.contrast">
  Box
</Box>
```

:::note
[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) uses [@mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data). When the library is updated, Style Props is also updated periodically.
:::

### Conditional Styles

Conditional styles allow you to apply styles to [pseudo-elements](/docs/styling/style-props#pseudo-elements), [pseudo-classes](/docs/styling/style-props#pseudo-classes), and [selectors](/docs/styling/style-props#selectors).

```tsx preview
<Box p="md" color="fg.contrast" bg={{ base: "bg.contrast", _hover: "success" }}>
  Hover me
</Box>
```

:::note
If you want to know more about the styling, please check [this](/docs/styling).
:::

### Color Schemes

Color schemes generate a color context for the component based on the values. This improves consistency in colors.

```tsx preview
<VStack gap="md">
  <Box
    p="md"
    colorScheme="blue"
    bg="colorScheme.solid"
    color="colorScheme.contrast"
  >
    Solid
  </Box>
  <Box
    p="md"
    colorScheme="green"
    bg="colorScheme.subtle"
    color="colorScheme.fg"
  >
    Subtle
  </Box>
</VStack>
```

Color schemes inherit the color scheme of the parent element.

```tsx preview
<VStack gap="md" colorScheme="blue">
  <Box p="md" bg="colorScheme.solid" color="colorScheme.contrast">
    Provided by Parent
  </Box>
  <Box
    p="md"
    colorScheme="green"
    bg="colorScheme.subtle"
    color="colorScheme.fg"
  >
    Child
  </Box>
</VStack>
```

:::note
If you want to know more about the color schemes, please check [this](/docs/styling/color-scheme).
:::

## Responsive Design

Responsive design refers to the breakpoints defined in the theme. Yamada UI has a default theme, and [breakpoints](/docs/theming/tokens/breakpoints) are defined.

To apply responsive design to [Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props), set an object with the breakpoints as the key.

- The keys of the object define the keys set in the theme's [breakpoints](/docs/theming/tokens/breakpoints).
- The values of the object define the values of the styles set by the key.

```tsx preview
<Box p="md" color="fg.contrast" bg={{ base: "bg.contrast", md: "success" }}>
  Box
</Box>
```

:::note
If you want to know more about the responsive design, please check [this](/docs/styling/responsive-design).
:::

## Color Mode

Yamada UI has built-in support for managing the application's color mode, allowing you to easily switch between light and dark modes. All provided components also support dark mode.

To apply color mode to [Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props), set an array.

- Set the value for light mode as the first element.
- Set the value for dark mode as the last element.

```tsx preview
<Box p="md" bg={["success", "warning"]} color="white">
  Box
</Box>
```

:::note
If you want to know more about the color mode, please check [this](/docs/styling/color-mode).
