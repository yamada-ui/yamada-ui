A theme is a modifiable object where tokens of many properties such as component styles, colors, spaces, font sizes, and others are defined.

Tokens of the theme are used in `Style props`. For each `Style props` reference, please check [here](/styled-system/style-props).

:::note
Yamada UI has a [Default Theme](/styled-system/theming/default-theme) that can be used immediately.
