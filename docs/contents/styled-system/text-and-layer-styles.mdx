In most projects, you may notice that certain `text properties (such as font size)` and `layer properties (such as background color)` are being repeated. As the scale of the project grows, it may become difficult to ensure design consistency.

By using `textStyle` and `layerStyle`, you can maintain design consistency.

## Customize the Theme

To use `textStyle` and `layerStyle`, you need to define tokens and styles in the theme.

```tsx live=false
import {
  UIProvider,
  extendTheme,
  LayerStyles,
  TextStyles,
} from "@yamada-ui/react"

const layerStyles: LayerStyles = {
  masterRoshi: {
    position: "relative",
    m: "md",
    boxSize: "4xs",
    border: "6px solid #000",
    rounded: "full",
    bg: "#FFF",
    fontFamily: "serif",
    color: "#000",
    fontSize: "8xl",
    fontWeight: "bold",
    _after: {
      content: '""',
      position: "absolute",
      top: "50%",
      left: "50%",
      transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
      zIndex: -1,
      rounded: "md",
      bg: "#FF7F0B",
      boxSize: "3xs",
    },
  },
}

const textStyles: TextStyles = {
  gradient: {
    fontSize: "5xl",
    bgGradient: "linear(to-r, orange.400, red.500)",
    bgClip: "text",
  },
}

const customTheme = extendTheme({ styles: { layerStyles, textStyles } })()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <UIProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <YourApplication />
    </UIProvider>
  )
}
```

## Layer Styles

To refer to the styles defined in the theme's `layerStyles`, set the token in `layerStyle`.

```tsx
<Center layerStyle="masterRoshi">Turtle</Center>
```

## Text Style

To refer to the style defined in the theme's `textStyles`, set the token to `textStyle`.

```tsx
<Heading textStyle="gradient" isTruncated>
  About Krillin... About Krillin!!!!!
</Heading>
```

## Other Styles

You can freely define tokens and styles in the theme's `styles`.

```tsx live=false
import { UIProvider, extendTheme } from "@yamada-ui/react"

const otherStyle: Record<string, CSSUIObject> = {
  title: {
    fontSize: "5xl",
    bgGradient: "linear(to-r, #59a9e1, #f37bdf)",
    bgClip: "text",
  },
}

const customTheme = extendTheme({ styles: { otherStyle } })()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <UIProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <YourApplication />
    </UIProvider>
  )
}
```

To reference the style defined in the theme's `styles`, set the token in `apply`.

```tsx
<Heading apply="otherStyle.title" isTruncated>
  My power level is 530,000. But of course, I have no intention of fighting you
  at full power, so don't worry...
</Heading>
```
