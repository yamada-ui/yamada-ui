title: Migration
description: New features and improvements from v1.x to v2.x.
---

## New Features

### Setup

Using [CLI](/docs/get-started/cli), you can easily set up Yamada UI in your project.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm yamada-cli init
```

```bash [npm]
npm yamada-cli init
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn yamada-cli init
```

```bash [bun]
bun yamada-cli init
```

:::

`init` command will display the following prompts.

```txt
Would you like to use monorepo? (recommended) … No / Yes
What is the path to the monorepo? … ./workspaces/ui
What is the package name? … @workspaces/ui
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? … No / Yes
Would you like to use Prettier? … No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? … No / Yes
```

### Download

From v2.x onwards, there are two ways to use components and hooks. One is the new method of downloading components and hooks locally via the [CLI](/docs/components/cli), and the other is the conventional method of importing them from the module.

By downloading the source code, you can customize the initial value or logic of the component or hook, and if there is a bug in the logic, you can fix it directly.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm yamada-cli add button
```

```bash [npm]
npm yamada-cli add button
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn yamada-cli add button
```

```bash [bun]
bun yamada-cli add button
```

:::

:::note
By downloading the source code and customizing it, you can easily update the source code by checking the [Check Differences](/docs/components/cli#check-differences) or [Update Components](/docs/components/cli#update-components) in [CLI](/docs/components/cli). If your changes conflict with the updates, they will be displayed in the same way as the [HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_how_conflicts_are_presented) of [Git](https://git-scm.com), and you can easily resolve them.
:::

### Namespace Import

You can now import components using namespaces.

```tsx
<Accordion.Root>
  <Accordion.Item>
    <Accordion.Button />
    <Accordion.Panel />
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion.Root>
```

:::note
You can still import components individually, but there are components whose names have changed due to the namespace. For example, in the case of `Accordion`, it has been changed to `AccordionRoot`.
:::

### createComponent

Using [createComponent](/docs/components/create-component), you can create components that support conditional styles such as variants.

```tsx
const componentStyle = defineComponentStyle({
  base: {
    /* base style */
  },
  variants: {
    /* variant style */
  },
  sizes: {
    /* size style */
  },
  props: {
    /* props style */
  },
  compounds: {
    /* compound style */
  },
  defaultProps: {
    /* default props */
  },
})

type ComponentStyle = typeof componentStyle

export interface ComponentProps
  extends HTMLStyledProps<"div">,
    ThemeProps<ComponentStyle> {}

const {
  component,
  ComponentContext,
  PropsContext: ComponentPropsContext,
  useComponentContext,
  usePropsContext: useComponentPropsContext,
  withContext,
  useComponentProps,
} = createComponent<ComponentProps, ComponentStyle>("component", componentStyle)

export { ComponentPropsContext, useComponentPropsContext }
```

```tsx
export const Component = withContext("div")()
```

### mergeProps

Using `mergeProps`, you can easily merge props while preventing props from disappearing. Previously, you had to create components while considering the provided props. Using `mergeProps`, you can focus on creating components without considering the provided props.

**Before**

```tsx
export const Component: FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  ref: forwardedRef,
  className,
  onClick: onClickProp,
  ...rest
}) => {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)

  const onClick = useCallback(() => {}, [])

  return (
    <Component
      ref={mergeRefs(forwardedRef, ref)}
      onClick={handlerAll(onClickProp, onClick)}
      className={[className, "component"].join(" ")}
      {...rest}
    />
  )
}
```

**After**

```tsx
export const Component: FC<ComponentProps> = (props) => {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)

  const onClick = useCallback(() => {}, [])

  return <Component {...mergeProps(props, { ref, onClick })()} />
}
```

### PropsContext

Using the `PropsContext` provided by each component, you can set the props of the components in the child elements in bulk.

```tsx client
const value = useMemo<BadgeProps>(() => ({ variant: "outline" }), [])

return (
  <BadgePropsContext value={value}>
    <Badge />
    <Badge />
    <Badge />
  </BadgePropsContext>
)
```

In the above example, the `Badge` in the child elements of `BadgePropsContext` will all have `variant` set to `"outline"`.

### Polymorphism

In addition to the traditional `as`, `asChild` has been added. `as` is used to change the element of the component itself, while `asChild` is used to incorporate the functionality and style of the component into the child elements.

**as**

```tsx
<Box as="button" />
```

**asChild**

```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <CustomComponent />
</Button>
```

### Cascade Layers

Using the [Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) of CSS, [Theme](/docs/theming) and [Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) now have priority. Please refer to [Cascade Layers](/docs/styling/cascade-layers) for more details.

### Focus Ring

[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) has been added [Focus Ring](/docs/styling/focus-ring). Focus Ring is a style used to identify the focused element. Please refer to [Focus Ring](/docs/styling/focus-ring) for more details.

```tsx
<Box focusRing="outline" />
```

```tsx
<Box focusVisibleRing="outline" />
```

### Interpolation

[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) now allows you to easily reference [CSS Custom Properties](/docs/styling/css-custom-properties) using its values. Please refer to [Interpolation](/docs/styling/interpolation) for more details.

```tsx
<Box {...{ "--custom-bg-color": "#1ba14c" }} bg="{custom-bg-color}" />
```

### CSS Custom Properties

[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) now allows you to easily set [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var). Please refer to [CSS Custom Properties](/docs/styling/css-custom-properties) for more details.

```tsx
<Box css={{ "--bg": "#d4d4d4" }} {...{ "--fg": "black" }} />
```

You can also reference the tokens of [Theme](/docs/theming).

```tsx
<Box
  css={{ "--bg": "colors.bg.contrast" }}
  {...{ "--fg": "colors.fg.contrast" }}
/>
```

### CSS Value Functions

[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) now allows you to use [CSS Value Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units/CSS_Value_Functions) and reference the corresponding [Theme](/docs/theming) tokens. Please refer to [CSS Value Functions](/docs/styling/css-value-functions) for more details.

```tsx
<Box w="calc(lg / 2)" />
```

```tsx
<Box bg="color-mix(red.500, blue.500)" />
```

### At-rules

[Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) has been added [At-rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule). Please refer to [At-rules](/docs/styling/at-rules) for more details.

```tsx
<Box _media={[{ type: "print", css: { color: "success" } }]} />
```

[Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) are also supported.

```tsx
<Box containerType="inline-size" resize="horizontal">
  <Box
    _container={[{ minW: "320px", maxW: "560px", css: { color: "success" } }]}
  />
</Box>
```

### Internationalization

To improve accessibility, we have supported 30 or more languages, including strings embedded in all components, date and number formats. Please refer to [Internationalization](/docs/components/internationalization) for more details.

### Icons

New icons have been added. Please refer to [Icons](/icons) for more details.

### Style Props

New CSS properties have been added. Please refer to [Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props) for more details.

### Theme

- New [keyframes](/docs/theming/tokens/keyframes), [aspectRatios](/docs/theming/tokens/aspect-ratios), [easings](/docs/theming/tokens/easings), and [durations](/docs/theming/tokens/durations) have been added to the theme tokens.
- `"mono"` has been added to the [Color Schemes](/docs/theming/tokens/color-schemes).
- New tokens have been added to the [Layer Styles](/docs/theming/styles/layer-styles).
- New tokens have been added to the [Text Styles](/docs/theming/styles/text-styles).
- New tokens have been added to the [Colors](/docs/theming/tokens/colors).
- You can now set `className` in the style object of the components.

## Improvements

### styled

[ui](https://v1.yamada-ui.com/styled-system/ui) has been renamed to [styled](/docs/components/styled). Also, since only the base style of the component could be set until now, it is now possible to set styles that vary depending on conditions, such as `variants` and `sizes`.

**Before**

```tsx
const Button = styled("button", {
  base: {
    alignItems: "center",
    appearance: "none",
    cursor: "pointer",
    display: "inline-flex",
    fontWeight: "medium",
    justifyContent: "center",
    overflow: "hidden",
    position: "relative",
    rounded: "l2",
    transitionDuration: "moderate",
    transitionProperty: "common",
    userSelect: "none",
    verticalAlign: "middle",
    whiteSpace: "nowrap",
    _readOnly: { layerStyle: "readOnly" },
    _disabled: { layerStyle: "disabled" },
  },
})
```

**After**

```tsx
const Button = styled("button", {
  base: {
    alignItems: "center",
    appearance: "none",
    cursor: "pointer",
    display: "inline-flex",
    fontWeight: "medium",
    justifyContent: "center",
    overflow: "hidden",
    position: "relative",
    rounded: "l2",
    transitionDuration: "moderate",
    transitionProperty: "common",
    userSelect: "none",
    verticalAlign: "middle",
    whiteSpace: "nowrap",
    _readOnly: { layerStyle: "readOnly" },
    _disabled: { layerStyle: "disabled" },
  },
  variants: {
    outline: {
      layerStyle: "outline",
      _hover: { layerStyle: "outline.hover" },
    },
    solid: {
      layerStyle: "solid",
      _hover: { layerStyle: "solid.hover" },
    },
    subtle: {
      layerStyle: "subtle",
      _hover: { layerStyle: "subtle.hover" },
    },
  },
})
```

### Conditional Styles

Conditional style setting has been simplified. The traditional setting can still be used.

**Before**

```tsx
<Box bg="bg.contrast" _hover={{ bg: "success" }} />
```

**After**

```tsx
<Box bg={{ base: "bg.contrast", _hover: "success" }} />
```

### Color Scheme

Previously, the [Color Scheme](/docs/styling/color-scheme) was set as props for each component. By integrating `colorScheme` into [Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props), it is now available for components other than components.

```tsx
<Box colorScheme="blue" bg="colorScheme.solid" color="colorScheme.contrast" />
```

Also, since `colorScheme` uses [CSS Custom Properties](/docs/styling/css-custom-properties) to generate a context, it is now also applied to the child elements.

```tsx
<Box colorScheme="blue">
  <Box bg="colorScheme.solid" color="colorScheme.contrast" />
  <Box colorScheme="green" bg="colorScheme.subtle" color="colorScheme.fg" />
</Box>
```

### Animation

Previously, the [Animation](/docs/styling/animation) used the [useAnimation](/docs/hooks/use-animation) hook. Now, you can set it directly from [Style Props](/docs/styling/style-props).

**Before**

```tsx
const animation = useAnimation({
  _keyframes: {
    from: { translate: "0 0" },
    to: { translate: "100% 0" },
  },
  duration: "1s",
  iterationCount: "infinite",
  timingFunction: "linear",
})

return <Box animation={animation} />
```

**After**

```tsx
<Box
  animationDirection="alternate"
  animationDuration="1s"
  animationIterationCount="infinite"
  animationTimingFunction="linear"
  _keyframes={{
    from: { translate: "0 0" },
    to: { translate: "100% 0" },
  }}
/>
```

### Components

- The styles of each component have been adjusted.
- The slot names of each component have been adjusted.
- The class names of each component have been adjusted.
- The naming convention of all boolean properties (`isOpen`, `isDisabled`, etc.) in the props of each component has been changed. For example, `isOpen` has been changed to `open`.

:::note
The improvement points of each component are described in the documentation of each component.
:::

### Style Props

- `color-mix` has been supported. If the browser does not support `color-mix`, the fallback value will be applied.
- `blur` and `brightness` can now be applied without setting `filter="auto"`.
- `backdropBlur` and `backdropBrightness` can now be applied without setting `backdropFilter="auto"`.

## Removed Features

### Packages
