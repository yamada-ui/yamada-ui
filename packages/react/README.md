## Respect

Yamada UI has drawn a lot of inspiration from [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), [MUI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) and [Mantine UI](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine). This has brought me wonderful experiences in my life. I am deeply grateful to Segun Adebayo and all the gods who have given me such experiences. And I love them.

## Documentation

It's the https://yamada-ui.com website for the latest version of Yamada UI.

## Features

- Ease of Styling: Yamada UI contains a set of layout components like `Box` and
  `Stack` that make it easy to style your components by passing props.
- Flexible & composable: Yamada UI components are built on top of a React UI
  Primitive for endless composability.
- Animation: Yamada UI provides hooks that allow for easy declaration of animations.
  These hooks can be written similar to CSS animations and are supported by all components.
- Color mode: Yamada UI makes it easy to set values for each color mode in the props of all components.
  This is not currently implemented in any other React UI component library.
- Theme switching: Yamada UI allows users to switch themes.
  Users can adapt their own themes and use web applications and websites.
  This is not currently implemented in any other React UI component library.
- Other features:
  Yamada UI comes with essential loading and notification features that are considered crucial for modern web applications and websites.
  This means you don't have to define them individually yourself.

## Installation

To use Yamada UI components, all you need to install the
`@yamada-ui/react` package.

```sh
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/react

# or

$ yarn add @yamada-ui/react

# or

$ npm install @yamada-ui/react
```

`@yamada-ui/table` and `@yamada-ui/calendar`, among others,
are not included with `@yamada-ui/react`.
You will need to install them separately.

```sh
# Provide a convenient Table component using `@tanstack/react-table`.
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/table

# Provide a convenient Calendar and datePicker, MonthPicker component
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/calendar

# Provide a convenient Carousel component using `embla-carousel-react`.
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/carousel

# Provide a convenient Dropzone component using `react-dropzone`.
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/dropzone

# Provide a convenient Chart component using `recharts`.
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/charts

# Provide a convenient Markdown component using `react-markdown` and `react-syntax-highlighter`.
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/markdown

# a package for conveniently using `Font Awesome`.
$ pnpm add @yamada-ui/fontawesome
```

## Usage

To get started with using the components, please follow the steps below:

1. Wrap your application with the `UIProvider` provided

```tsx
import { UIProvider } from "@yamada-ui/react"

const App = ({ children }) => {
  return <UIProvider>{children}</UIProvider>
}

export default App
```

Yamada UI supports light and dark modes by default

2. Now you can start using components like so

```tsx
import { Box, Text } from "@yamada-ui/react"

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Text>ギャルのパンティーおくれーーーっ！！！！！</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}
```
