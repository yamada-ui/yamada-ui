You can use the Yamada CLI to generate types for tokens of your customized theme, such as colors and font sizes.

## Installation

Execute one of the following commands in your terminal.

<PackageManagers
  packageNameOrCommand={{
    pnpm: "pnpm add --save-dev @yamada-ui/cli",
    npm: "npm install --save-dev @yamada-ui/cli",
    yarn: "yarn add --dev @yamada-ui/cli",
    bun: "bun add --dev @yamada-ui/cli",
  }}
/>

## Usage

### Update Type Definitions

By using the CLI, you can update the type completions for the theme tokens that [Style Props](/styled-system/style-props) refer to.

Add a script to your `package.json` and specify the location of your customized theme within the script.

```json title=package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts" : {
    ...
    "theme" : "yamada-cli tokens path/to/theme.ts",
  } „ÄÅ
  ...
}
```

:::note status=warning
Don't forget to replace `path/to/theme.ts`.
:::

:::note status=warning
The updated type definitions will be overwritten each time they are installed, so you need to run it again after each installation.
:::

Now, execute the script you just added.

<PackageManagers
  packageNameOrCommand={{
    pnpm: "pnpm theme",
    npm: "npm run theme",
    yarn: "yarn theme",
    bun: "bun run theme",
  }}
/>

### Generate Theme

You can use the CLI to generate the default theme locally.

<PackageManagers
  packageNameOrCommand={{
    pnpm: "pnpm yamada-cli theme ./theme",
    npm: "npm run yamada-cli theme ./theme",
    yarn: "yarn yamada-cli theme ./theme",
    bun: "bun run yamada-cli theme ./theme",
  }}
/>
