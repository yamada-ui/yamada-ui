`Drawer` follows the [WAI-ARIA - Dialog (Modal) Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) for accessibility.

- When the modal opens, focus is automatically set to the first enabled element, or the element from `initialFocusRef`.
- When the modal closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before the modal activated, or the element from `finalFocusRef`.
- Clicking on the overlay closes the modal.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the modal.

Set `aria-haspopup="dialog"` on the element that triggers the modal to inform the user that the dialog will open.

```tsx live=false
const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()

return (
  <>
    <Button aria-haspopup="dialog" onClick={onOpen}>
      Open Drawer
    </Button>

    <Drawer isOpen={isOpen} onClose={onClose}>
      <DrawerHeader>ドラゴンボール</DrawerHeader>

      <DrawerBody>
        『ドラゴンボール』は、鳥山明による日本の漫画作品です。...
      </DrawerBody>

      <DrawerFooter>
        <Button variant="ghost" onClick={onClose}>
          とじる
        </Button>
        <Button colorScheme="primary">Wikipedia</Button>
      </DrawerFooter>
    </Drawer>
  </>
)
```

## Keyboard Navigation

When the modal opens, focus is trapped within it. That is, you cannot focus on elements outside the modal unless the modal is closed.

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`           | Focuses the next element within the modal that is not disabled. If it's the last element, focuses the first element within the modal that is not disabled.     | `isOpen={true}`                       |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Focuses the previous element within the modal that is not disabled. If it's the first element, focuses the last element within the modal that is not disabled. | `isOpen={true}`                       |
| `Escape`        | Closes the modal.                                                                                                                                              | `isOpen={true}` + `closeOnEsc={true}` |
