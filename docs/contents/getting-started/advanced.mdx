In this guide, we will explain the applications of the concepts and features described in [Learn the Basics](/getting-started/basics).

## Applying Themes

Yamada UI offers a richer set of theme utilities than other UI libraries.

In [Learn the Basics](/getting-started/basics#about-themes), you learned how to use `extendTheme` for theme inheritance. Here, you will learn how to change the `colorScheme` set in each component and how to get the value of tokens defined in the theme.

To change the `colorScheme` set in each component, use `withDefaultColorScheme`.

:::note
We also provide `withDefaultSize` to change the size, and `withDefaultVariant` to change the variant.
:::

### Using `withDefaultColorScheme`

Most of the components provided by Yamada UI have `primary` set as the default `colorScheme`. Use `withDefaultColorScheme` to change it to `secondary`.

```tsx live=false highlight={3,4,5,6,7,8,12}
import { UIProvider, extendTheme } from "@yamada-ui/react"

const customTheme = extendTheme(
  withDefaultColorScheme({
    colorScheme: "secondary",
    components: ["Badge", "Tag", "Button"], // If you pass an empty array, it will be set for all components.
  }),
)()

const App = () => {
  return (
    <UIProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <YourApplication />
    </UIProvider>
  )
}
```

### Using `useToken`

In a component, if you want to get the value of a token defined in the theme, use `useToken`.

```tsx functional=true
const bg = useToken("colors", "primary")

return (
  <Box bg={bg} p="md" color="white">
    Primary for color tokens is "{bg}"
  </Box>
)
```

This is suitable for setting the style of components from libraries other than Yamada UI.

:::

## Applying Styles

In [Learn the Basics](/getting-started/basics#about-styles), you learned about `Style props` and shorthand. Here, you will learn about how to change the rendering of elements and the importance of the Yamada UI style system.

### About `as`

All components of Yamada UI can perform `assertions`.

An `assertion` is a feature that allows you to pass HTML tags or other components to a component, rendering it as a different element or component while retaining the original component's style and behavior.

For example, suppose you need to change the `Button` to the HTML tag `a` while retaining its style and behavior.

```tsx
<Button as="a" href="https://github.com/yamada-ui/yamada-ui" target="_blank">
  GitHub
</Button>
```

:::note
Yamada UI `recommends` developers to set `as` for each component. This is because many components are `div`, and without properly setting `header` or `footer`, you cannot say that you are structuring the text into logical sections. Let's actively set `as`.
:::

### About `sx` and `css`

Yamada UI provides `sx` and `css` in addition to `Style props` for setting styles.

- `sx`: Accepts an object that can use theme tokens similar to `Style props` and can also describe `CSS` selectors, etc.
- `css`: Accepts the `CSS` object of [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

:::note status=warning
There are hardly any cases where `sx` and `css` are necessary. As long as you understand the existence of `sx` and `css` in the [About Order](/getting-started/advanced#about-order) section explained in the next section, there will be no problem.
:::

```tsx
<Box
  p="md"
  display="flex"
  gap="sm"
  sx={{
    "&:hover > p": {
      color: "danger",
    },
  }}
>
  <Text as="span">Hover me!</Text>
  <Text>This is Text</Text>
</Box>
```

:::note status=warning
`css` cannot use Yamada UI's `Style props`.
:::

### About Order

Yamada UI components accept several `CSS` objects and have a set order.

The order is as follows, and the same property values will be overwritten.

1. `baseStyle`: The `baseStyle` object of the theme
2. `size`: The `size` object of the theme
3. `variant`: The `variant` object of the theme
4. `props`: The `props` of the component's style
5. `sx`: The `sx` `props` of the component
6. `css`: The `css` `props` of the component

:::note

:::

## Application of Responsive

In [Learn the Basics](/getting-started/basics#about-responsive), you learned how to set up responsive styles. Here, you will learn how to get the current breakpoint and useful utilities.

### Using `useBreakpoint`

To get the current breakpoint within a component, use `useBreakpoint`.

```tsx functional=true
const breakpoint = useBreakpoint()

return <Box p="md">The current breakpoint is "{breakpoint}"</Box>
```

### Using `useBreakpointValue`

`useBreakpointValue` is a custom hook that returns the value of the current breakpoint from the object passed as an argument.

```tsx functional=true
const breakpoint = useBreakpoint()
const bg = useBreakpointValue({
  base: "red.500",
  "2xl": "pink.500",
  xl: "blue.500",
  lg: "green.500",
  md: "yellow.500",
  sm: "purple.500",
})

return (
  <Box bg={bg} p="md" color="white">
    The current breakpoint is "{breakpoint}"
  </Box>
)
```

This is suitable for setting the style of components from libraries other than Yamada UI.

## Application of Color Mode

In [Learn the Basics](/getting-started/basics#about-color-mode), you learned how to set the style of color mode. Here, you will learn how to get the current color mode and useful utilities.

### Using `useColorMode`

To get the current color mode within a component, use `useColorMode`.

```tsx functional=true
const { colorMode, internalColorMode } = useColorMode()

return (
  <Box p="md">
    The current colorMode is "{colorMode}", internal colorMode is "
    {internalColorMode}"
  </Box>
)
```

:::note
`colorMode` returns the current `light` or `dark`.
`internalColorMode` returns the current `light`, `dark`, or `system`.
:::

### Using `useColorModeValue`

`useColorModeValue` is a custom hook that takes the light mode value as the first argument and the dark mode value as the second argument, and returns the value of the current color mode.

```tsx functional=true
const { colorMode } = useColorMode()
const bg = useColorModeValue("blackAlpha.800", "whiteAlpha.800")
const color = useColorModeValue("whiteAlpha.800", "blackAlpha.800")

return (
  <Box p="md" bg={bg} color={color}>
    The current colorMode is "{colorMode}"
  </Box>
)
```

This is suitable for setting the style of components from libraries other than Yamada UI.

:::note
If you want to learn more about color modes, please check [here](/styled-system/color-mode).
:::

## Application of Animation

In [Learn the Basics](/getting-started/basics#About-Animation), you learned about the `useAnimation` and `Motion` components. Here, you will learn about setting multiple animations with `useAnimation` and setting new dynamic animations with `useDynamicAnimation`. Please check [here](/getting-started/basics#About-Animation).

### Using Multiple Animations with `useAnimation`

`useAnimation` can also accept arrays.

```tsx functional=true
const animation = useAnimation([
  {
    keyframes: {
      "0%": {
        bg: "red.500",
      },
      "20%": {
        bg: "green.500",
      },
      "40%": {
        bg: "purple.500",
      },
      "60%": {
        bg: "yellow.500",
      },
      "80%": {
        bg: "blue.500",
      },
      "100%": {
        bg: "red.500",
      },
    },
    duration: "10s",
    iterationCount: "infinite",
    timingFunction: "linear",
  },
  {
    keyframes: {
      "0%": {
        h: "xs",
      },
      "50%": {
        h: "md",
      },
      "100%": {
        h: "xs",
      },
    },
    duration: "10s",
    iterationCount: "infinite",
    timingFunction: "linear",
  },
  {
    keyframes: {
      "0%": {
        w: "full",
      },
      "50%": {
        w: "50%",
      },
      "100%": {
        w: "full",
      },
    },
    duration: "10s",
    iterationCount: "infinite",
    timingFunction: "linear",
  },
])

return (
  <Box h="md">
    <Box w="full" h="xs" animation={animation} />
  </Box>
)
```

### Usage of `useDynamicAnimation`

`useDynamicAnimation` takes an object as an argument. The keys of the object become the keys of the animation, and the animation changes by passing the key as an argument to `setState`.

```tsx functional=true
const [animation, setAnimation] = useDynamicAnimation({
  moveLeft: {
    keyframes: {
      "0%": {
        transform: "translateX(400%)",
      },
      "100%": {
        transform: "translateX(0%)",
      },
    },
    duration: "slower",
    fillMode: "forwards",
    timingFunction: "ease-in-out",
  },
  moveRight: {
    keyframes: {
      "0%": {
        transform: "translateX(0%)",
      },
      "100%": {
        transform: "translateX(400%)",
      },
    },
    duration: "slower",
    fillMode: "forwards",
    timingFunction: "ease-in-out",
  },
})

return (
  <VStack alignItems="flex-start">
    <Button
      onClick={() =>
        setAnimation((prev) =>
          prev === "moveRight" ? "moveLeft" : "moveRight",
        )
      }
    >
      Click me!
    </Button>

    <Box bg="primary" p="md" rounded="md" color="white" animation={animation}>
      Box
    </Box>
  </VStack>
)
```

It is also possible to combine dynamic animations and multiple animations.

```tsx functional=true
const [animation, setAnimation] = useDynamicAnimation<
  Record<"moveLeft" | "moveRight", AnimationStyle[]>
>({
  moveLeft: [
    {
      keyframes: {
        "0%": {
          transform: "translateX(400%)",
        },
        "100%": {
          transform: "translateX(0%)",
        },
      },
      duration: "slower",
      fillMode: "forwards",
      timingFunction: "ease-in-out",
    },
    {
      keyframes: {
        "0%": {
          bg: "secondary",
        },
        "100%": {
          bg: "primary",
        },
      },
      duration: "slower",
      fillMode: "forwards",
      timingFunction: "ease-in-out",
    },
  ],
  moveRight: [
    {
      keyframes: {
        "0%": {
          transform: "translateX(0%)",
        },
        "100%": {
          transform: "translateX(400%)",
        },
      },
      duration: "slower",
      fillMode: "forwards",
      timingFunction: "ease-in-out",
    },
    {
      keyframes: {
        "0%": {
          bg: "primary",
        },
        "100%": {
          bg: "secondary",
        },
      },
      duration: "slower",
      fillMode: "forwards",
      timingFunction: "ease-in-out",
    },
  ],
})

return (
  <VStack alignItems="flex-start">
    <Button
      onClick={() =>
        setAnimation((prev) =>
          prev === "moveRight" ? "moveLeft" : "moveRight",
        )
      }
    >
      Click me!
    </Button>

    <Box bg="primary" p="md" rounded="md" color="white" animation={animation}>
      Box
    </Box>
  </VStack>
)
```
